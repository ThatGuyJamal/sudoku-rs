## Todo

While the game is playable in theory, it can have some improvments. 

- [ ] Randomized Puzzle Generations

> Right now only one demo puzzle is hard coded into the game 

- [ ] Saving current game progess

> Currently when the application is closed all data is lost. It would be nice to have a local save of the current game data.

- [ ] A button to generate a new game after the current game is completed.
